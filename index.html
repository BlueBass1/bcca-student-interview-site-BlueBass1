            I am Jeremiah Bass. I'm a student at Base Camp coding academy (BCCA).
            <br>I interviewed my tablemate for the week, Sean Coh. I aksed him three quesitons.
            <li class="text-color">I asked him what has been the toughest week at base camp,
            </li>
            <li class="text-color">what has been the easiest week at base camp,
            </li>
            <li class="text-color">and what is your biggest victory so far?
            </li>
        </p>
        <p class="text-color">
            In response, he told me that:
            <li class="text-color">his toughest week was week 3. The week we were dealing with functions.</li>
            <li class="text-color">His easiest week was week 4. The week where we dealt with io's.</li>
            <li class="text-color">And lastly, his biggest victory has been getting two benchmarks in a row correct.
            </li>
            Which, coming from my own personal experience, is something that's not the easiest thing to do.
        </p>

            The interview itself took place during the first block of class at BCCA.
