    <p class="lightskyblue-text center-text">
        I am Jeremiah Bass. I'm a student at Base Camp coding academy (BCCA).
        I interviewed my tablemate for the week, Sean Coh. These are the three questions asked him.
    </p>
    <ul class="lightskyblue-text center-list">
        <li>I asked him what has been the toughest week at base camp</li>
        <li>what has been the easiest week at base camp</li>
        <li>and what is your biggest victory so far?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="lightskyblue-text center-text">
        In response, he told me that:
    </p>
    <ul class="lightskyblue-text center-list">
        <li>his toughest week was week 3. The week we were dealing with functions.</li>
        <li>His easiest week was week 4. The week where we dealt with io's.</li>
        <li>And lastly, his biggest victory has been getting two benchmarks in a row correct.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="lightskyblue-text center-text">
        The interview itself took place during the first block of class at BCCA.
        Also, to give you some context behind some of the responses, BCCA is not a lightweight course.
        The pacing here is fast, and the beginning part is rough.
        That's why getting two benchmarks in a row is something to be proud of,
        and it's why the toughest week is right behind the easiest week.
        Many of us were still getting our barrings straight.
        We are recently getting to a point where things are starting to level out.
